# Gulp Practice

This project helped to understand how modules works in js using browserify. 
Also, this helped a lot when fixing w3c errors in several pages.

Technologies I used: 

- Gulp
- npm and yarn ( I just wanted to see if yarn was faster than npm, and yes it is :P )
- Some ES6 functionallity ( I am getting into it)


I also used some kind of controller (initializer) to run the js modules depending on two factors:

- If the UI element is present (the HTML component to which the module refers to)
- A 'autoLunch' attribute. If set to true, it will run the js module
